## 1. Agreement

These Terms govern access to and use of the Torvus Security marketing site and private beta services (collectively, the "Services"). By requesting access, signing an order, or using the Services you agree to these Terms on behalf of yourself or the organisation you represent.

## 2. Accounts and responsibilities

Administrators are responsible for configuring policies, managing recipient access, and keeping authentication factors secure. You must immediately notify Torvus if you suspect unauthorised access or believe policies have been misconfigured.

## 3. Acceptable use

You may not:

- Attempt to bypass encryption, rate limits, or safety controls.
- Upload unlawful content or material infringing third-party rights.
- Probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Services without written approval.

We may suspend or terminate access for violations that jeopardise security, legal compliance, or other customers.

## 4. Beta services

Features provided in private beta are for evaluation only, may change without notice, and are offered "as is". Torvus disclaims all warranties to the fullest extent permitted by law. Production SLAs, warranties, and indemnities will be documented in separate agreements when the product reaches general availability.

## 5. Confidentiality

Each party agrees to protect confidential information received from the other using the same care it applies to its own confidential data. Torvus will maintain the confidentiality of your encrypted content, policy metadata, and audit records in accordance with the [Privacy Notice](/legal/privacy) and customer agreements.

## 6. Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Torvusâ€™ aggregate liability arising out of or relating to the Services is limited to direct damages up to the amount you paid for the Services in the twelve months preceding the claim. Torvus is not liable for lost profits, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages.

## 7. Governing law

These Terms are governed by the laws of New South Wales, Australia. Any dispute will be handled in the courts of New South Wales, unless another forum is mutually agreed.

## 8. Updates

We may update these Terms to reflect new functionality, legal requirements, or operational changes. Updates become effective when posted. Continued use after an update constitutes acceptance.
