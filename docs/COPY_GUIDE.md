# Copy Guide

Torvus communicates with high-trust, high-consequence teams. Use concise, confident language that explains capability without overpromising.

- **Voice:** direct, pragmatic, calm under pressure.
- **Value framing:** emphasise policy control, zero-knowledge guarantees, and operational readiness.
- **Forbidden phrases:** avoid "unbreakable", "perfect security", or claims that imply Torvus can see plaintext.
- **CTAs:** invite conversation or planning ("Join the waitlist", "Talk with our team") rather than hard sells.

When writing new sections, prefer short paragraphs (2â€“3 sentences) and highlight actions or proof (attestation, provenance, approvals) over adjectives.
